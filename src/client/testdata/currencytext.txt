SELL] Europe - Evolve Bamboo GT, with GTX battery installed with 48 cycles. \n\nI have bought GTX and made my own 18650 battery pack so I have transferred GTX battery to my GT.\n\nIt has R2 remote and 3D printed spacer below battery case so no rooting of the deck was done. \n\nBamboo GT was bought new from evolve Germany in March 2018. Still got all the papers. \n\nSo what you get:\n\nEvolve Bamboo GT with GTX battery installed\nR2 remote (not a single disconnect so far)\n97mm evolve wheels (around 100km ridden)\nEvolve charger 2A\nSkate tool\n\nThe only reason I am selling it is because I have GTX as well and I don't need two eSkates. \n\nPrice: 1400 Euro \n\n[Bamboo GT/GTX](https://imgur.com/a/lhsUH7N) \n\n\n
